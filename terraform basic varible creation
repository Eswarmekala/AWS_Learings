in variable we have 2 types in terrrafrom they are :
input variables thesee are used passed to aws 
eg :
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  
  ami = var.ami_value .
}

the varible neeed to define using keywoard called varible.
eg:
varible "instance_type"
type = string
default = "t2.micro"

if dont want to use defult varible then we need to pass using terrafrom apply command.

output varibles these are used get information 
eg :
output "public_ip"
value = resource.resourcename 


we can organize our code by using below :


we use provider.tf to pass provider details

eg:

provider "aws" {
region = "us-east-1"
aws_screat key = "klldld"
}

your main.ft will have your terrafrom code 

then your input varibles wii be input.fr
also output varibles in output.tf
these names also can we changed


to write terrafrom dynamically we use tf.vars to pass varibles.
